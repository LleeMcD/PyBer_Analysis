# PyBer Analysis - Overview
## Purpose 
The purpose of the project was to perform an exploratory analysis for Pyber's Python based ride-sharing application. The task was to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to create compelling visualizations that would assist Pyber with the improvement of access to ride-sharing services and also to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Process
The data, which was stored in large comma separated values (csv) files, was imported into data frames, inspected and merged into one large data frame. Additional data frames were then created to extract specific information for the visualizations for each city type (urban, suburban, rural). 
- Total rides for each city type
- Total drivers for each city type
- Total amount of fares for each city type
- Average fare per driver for each city type

## Results
The following visualizations were then created from this data:

The findings indicated the following:
- Urban cities had the highest percentage of Pyber rides at 68.4%.
- The percentage of total rides for suburban cities at 26.3%, was less than half that of the Urban cities.
- The rural cities had the lowest percentage of total rides at just 5.3%.
- Pyber ride usage and fares:
  - Urban
    - Highest usage and fares: March and April
    - Lowest usage and fares: May
 - Suburban
    - Highest usage and fares: February
    - Lowest usage and fares: May     
  - Urban
    - Highest usage and fares: April
    - Lowest usage and fares: May  
- Pyber driver population
  - Urban cities had 80.9% of the total number of Pyber drivers.
  - Suburban cities had 16.5% of the total number of Pyber drivers.
  - Rural cities had 2.6% of the total number of Pyber drivers.
