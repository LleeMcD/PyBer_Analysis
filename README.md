# PyBer Analysis - Overview
## Purpose 
The purpose of the project was to perform an exploratory analysis for Pyber's Python based ride-sharing application. The task was to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 to create a compelling visualization that would assist Pyber with the improvement of access to ride-sharing services and also to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Process
The data, which was stored in large comma separated values (csv) files, was imported into data frames, inspected and merged into one large data frame. Additional data frames were then created to extract specific information for the visualizations for each city type (urban, suburban, rural). The following informaiton was retrieved:
- Total rides for each city type
- Total drivers for each city type
- Total amount of fares for each city type
- Average fare per driver for each city type
Visualizations were then created from this data;




A multiline plot showing the total weekly fares for each city type

## Results
The findings indicated:
- The total fares were the highest for urban cities during the end of February and the middle of March.
- The percentage of total fares by city
